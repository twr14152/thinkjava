# ThinkJava 2nd Edition

This is my interpretation of the code related to the book by Allen Downey and Chris Mayfield.

This is the first time I've used Java. My goal is to get a deeper understanding of Object Oriented Programming. Java is considered to be a more pure form of OOP than say Python or C++. Definitaely can see C's influence on the code style. 

Will provide my thoughts of the book and how it pertained to my goal upon completion.
